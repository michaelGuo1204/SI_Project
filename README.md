## Description
In this project we are trying to conduct Nash Equilibrium analysis based on the Genetic Algorithm. Here are my plan for this project
| Name                   | Role                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Qirui Guo              | - [ ] Design and equipment of genetic algorithm on GPU             |
| YuJie Chen             | - [ ] Design of a Nash Genetic Algorithm                           |
| Weizhe Wang & Jialu Li | - [ ] Design of a object function describing the conflict between male/female in Mating Problem |

## Reference
I have uploaded a [book](https://github.com/michaelGuo1204/SI_Project/blob/6654735226920b2a80ca08e844c4ca041e4824e9/Reference/Game-Theoretical%20Models%20in%20Biology%20by%20Mark%20Broom,%20Jan%20Rychtar%20(z-lib.org).pdf) in the reference, Please read **Chapter 1-8 and Chapter 14** in the vacation (for Jialu and Jiji )
> It might be tough reading the book, take it easy, we will have a disscussion on Monday (14,June) 

For Yujie, Please continue the process on developing the algorithm, if you think their is nothing to upgarde, please start to write the article, and prepare to help Jialu and Jiji
